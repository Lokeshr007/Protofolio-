            Hello! I'm Lokesh R, a dedicated Computer Science and Engineering student at Erode Sengunthar Engineering College. I have a strong foundation in programming and a keen interest in technology and innovation. 
            <br><br>
            I completed a Python course on Infosys Springboard, where I gained hands-on experience with data analysis and automation. Additionally, I attended a workshop on Phishing Attacks at SNS College, which enhanced my understanding of cybersecurity. My skills in Bash Shell Scripting were further developed during a workshop at PSG College. 
            <br><br>
            I also had the opportunity to present an ecommerce project, which helped me hone my skills in web development and project management. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges that push me to grow.
